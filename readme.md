A bash script that can power down `Nvidia Optimus` cards automatically, inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/sqqzl4/nvidia_primerun_on_wayland_instead_of_nvidiaxrun/)

# Install

## Required packages

```pacman
lib32-nvidia-utils
nvidia
nvidia-utils
cronie
nvidia-prime (Optional)
nvidia-settings (Optional)
```

## Install `prime`

Download the executable 'prime' and copy it into `/sbin`

## Configuration

### Blacklist Module

Add `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia.conf` to blacklist Nvidia kernel modules

```blacklist-nvidia.conf
blacklist nvidia
blacklist nvidia-drm
blacklist nvidia-modeset
blacklist nvidia_uvm
install nvidia /bin/false
```

<mark> If you want to modprobe the kernel module, please add `--ignore-install`Â </mark>

### Add a `cronie` rule

#### Get your BUS id

```bash
lspci | grep -i nvidia | awk '{print $1}'
```

#### Edit crontab

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add this line:

```bash
@reboot sleep 5s && echo 'auto' > '/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:03:00.0/power/control
```

Where `03:00.0` is your Bus id.

### Environment (APUs)

`/etc/environment`

Add

```environment
VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/radeon_icd.x86_64.json
```



# Start Applications on dGPU

```bash
_render=[all, display, vulkan] prime [command]
```

| Syntax (_render) | Effects                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| all              | Render your application and process Vulkan commands on your dGPU |
| display          | Render you application on dGPU (Similar to prime-run)        |
| vulkan           | Process vulkan commands on dGPU ( Works on `dxvk` games like `GTAV` on Proton ) |

# Advanced

## Change the BUS ID

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/Witko/nvidia-xrun#setting-the-right-bus-id) to change your BUS ID for `nvidia-xrun`

Edit the prime executable, replace all the `03:00.0` to your BUS ID, which can be found by 

```bash
lspci | grep -i nvidia | awk '{print $1}'
```



This will enable `prime` to apply proper power control to your card

# How does `prime` work?

When your computer boots, Nvidia modules are blacklisted so that they won't be loaded.

Then, the cron rule added before will enable kernel's default power management for your dGPU.

Once you call the command `prime`, it tells the Linux kernel to rescan all PCIe devices and load Nvidia kernel modules to pass some essential syntax to offload on your dGPU.

After all applications running through `prime` shutdown, it will remove the Nvidia kernel modules so that other  applications won't use your graphics card from time to time. (As I know, Firefox activates my GPU when a video is being played and Chromium activates my GPU every time when it starts)
